# fair-teams-ai

Tired of listening to your friends whine about how unfair your CS:GO teams are? Enraged by the arrays, I'm sorry..."matrices", that start at `1` of your buddys MATLAB script?
*Fair Teams AI* automagically creates balanced team assignments for your next match.

## Work in progress

The project is very new and there's still lots to do. Please check the [Projects](https://github.com/diveflo/fair-teams-ai/projects) page to see the current progress on the different aspects of the app.
